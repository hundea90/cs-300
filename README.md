# cs-300
I performed two main projects in this Cs-300 course, such as project one winch is developed non coding development using advanced algorithms design and wrote pseudocode detail include Big O notation analysis and memory consumption details for each data structure vector, hash table and tree. The second project was developed code using project one pseudocode algorithm and data structure. I created code in C++ based on Project One, which sorts and prints a list of courses in alphanumeric order.   

 What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?  

Project, one created a pseudocode explaining the details of the Computer Science department at ABCU, printed a list of Computer Science courses in alphanumeric order, and provided course information and prerequisites for a given course. I solved this problem using pseudocode, opening and reading data from files, creating course objects, implementing a menu system, and sorting and displaying course lists. Meanwhile, in project two, using project one, pseudocode and create code appropriately run code according to instructions.  

How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.  

  

I realized how to write code that is to maintain, read, or adapt by making changes that follow appropriate standards. Understanding data structures is crucial because they directly impact the efficiency of algorithms. I carefully selected data structures based on their performance characteristics to optimize my solutions.  

  

How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?  

I started project early and got more time to refer to zBook and tutor for every obstacle, which helped me a lot.  I encountered challenges with optimizing the sorting algorithm in Project Two. I spent a lot of time on it due to the project's complexity on my laptop and got exhausted extensively, so I took some breaks between more extended work hours.   

How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?  

This project helps me build my programming skills one step ahead and has reshaped the way I approach maintainable, readable, and adaptable skills. It has also helped me identify errors and ensure the quality of my code.  

  

How has your work on this project evolved how you write maintainable, readable, and adaptable programs?  

Working on these projects has improved my ability to write maintainable and adaptable code. I've focused on coding standards to ensure my code is easy to understand and modify.
